# Dashboard-widget


This is a simple Dashboard application which comes with a Task manager, News feed and a Weather widget.
(sorry about the UI designing, could use MUI, I didn't put that much effort on UI since this is a simple application which measures the coding skills)

Used APIs
  [News API](https://newsapi.org/)
  [Wether API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

Instructions on how to set up and run the project locally.
  1. Clone the project repository from gihub to your local machine.
  2. Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your machine.
  3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory.
  I prefer YARN over NPM (NPM installs packages sequentially, Yarn performs parallel installation resulting in better speed and performance)
  4. Install project dependencies by running the following command: `yarn`

  5. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running the following command: `yarn start`


  6. This command will start the development server, and the project will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

  7. To install Jest as a development dependency, run the following command: `yarn add --dev react-test-renderer`

  8. Once Jest is installed, you can run the tests using the following command: `yarn test`

  I used ESLint and Prettier to take care of the styles and formatting of the code

### NOTE: News feed not working under the production. So I add some images to show how news feed look like locally
